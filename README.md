## Readme
### What does it do?
- This tool uses PowerShell to keep riffraff out of your open session RDR2 and GTAO games.

### How do I set it up?
- Download and install [KeepErSafe](https://github.com/Xechorizo/KeepErSafe/blob/master/KeepErSafe.msi).
- Set it to Run As Administrator.
- Add your friends' IP addresses to the list. 

### How do I use it?
- (RDR2 Only) Use the menu to get to the Change Appearance screen.
- Click "Root'n Toot'n" to enable. Everyone is kicked out of your session.
- (RDR2 Only) Return to game.
- Click "Cowboy Shoot'n" to disable so your friends can join.
- Have your friends join your session. They also need KeepErSafe installed, with your IP added to their whitelist.
