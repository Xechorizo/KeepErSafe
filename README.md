## Readme
### What does it do?
- This tool uses PowerShell to keep modders and other scum out of your open session GTAO and RDR2 sessions.

### How do I set it up?
- Download and install [KeepErSafe](https://github.com/Xechorizo/KeepErSafe/blob/master/KeepErSafe.msi).
- Add your friends' IP addresses to the list, or try the Automagic button.

### How do I use it?
- (RDR2 Only) Use the menu to get to the Change Appearance screen.
- Click "Enable". Everyone is kicked out of your session.
- (RDR2 Only) Return to game.
- Click "Disable" to disable so your friends can join.
- Have your friends join your session. Return to game.
- (RDR2 Only) Your friends also need KeepErSafe installed, with your IP added to their whitelist.
- Once everyone's in-game, click "Enable".
- (RDR2 Only) Everyone clicks "Enable" at the same time.
- No more modders!

### How does it work?
- It creates firewall rules to blacklist all IP ranges between the whitelisted IP addresses of your friends.
- It does not modify the game files nor memory in any shape or form.
